## Requirements
- CUDA capable graphics card (Link to place where it says which are capable)
- Webcam or Machine Vision Camera
- CUDA capable GPU with CUDA installed
- OpenCV installed and compiled for CUDA (same version that you have installed)

## Compilation Instructions
- Visual Studio 2015 (others *may* work)
- Set up Environment variables 
    - OPEN_CV_INSTALL_DIR to install directory of opencv
        - Allows header path finding and prebuild event to copy dlls
- Rewrite CameraController.cpp to return a BGR image with whatever imaging device is used
- Modify Arena.props
- Modify prebuild events to camera specific DLL's and headers

## Limitations
- Skin Detection
    - Colour gradients caused by different colour lighting from different light sources can cause failures
    - Flourescent light is preferred (yellow light causes colour issues and sun light is too bring)
    - Requires face is in image
- Multiple Users
    - If the different users have similarly coloured skin, they will conflict. There is hooks in the software to fix this, but they have not been implemented.
- Convexity Analysis (Gesture Recognition)
    - Hands must be near head level
    - Hands must be roughly vertical
- Gesture Tracking
    - Registered callbacks are called when a specified gesture is held for 500ms before a different gesture is held for 500ms within a 3 second timespan
