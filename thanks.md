## Supervisors
This project was done in collaboration with:
- **Dr. Alexandra Albu (University of Victoria)**
- **Neerav Patel (Lucid Vision Labs)**

## Thanks to
- **Dr. Alexandra Albu** for taking the time to help me during this project, providing insight, and being flexible in letting me do it remotely
- **Neerav Patel** for providing feedback, discussion and being flexible with working hours so I could get this project done on time
- **Ilamparithi Thirumarai Chelvan** for hosting the course and allowing me to work in a different city while taking it
- **Lucid Vision Labs** for providing me with a camera, lens, and other equipment I needed, and also full-time employment while I was taking this course
- **Family and Friends** for supporting me throughout the years as I made my way to this point  
- **The OpenCV Community** for all the image processing functions they have made available
