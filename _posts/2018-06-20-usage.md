## Requirements
- CUDA capable graphics card (Link to place where it says which are capable)
- 64 bit PC
- Webcam or Lucid Vision Labs camera
- CUDA installed (link to instructions and note about how I got screwed when I upgraded my graphics card first)
- OpenCV installed and compiled for CUDA (link to where I found it precompiled)

## Compilation Instructions
- Visual Studio 2015 (others *may* work)
- Set up Environment variables (ENV_VARS so prebuild event can copy binaries into bin)
- Configure settings (setup defines for webcam or lucid vision labs camera)

## Limitations
- Limitations should be in each section (example limitations of tracking or limitations of convexity analysis, put overview of all here)
